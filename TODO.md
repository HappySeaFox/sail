## Priority 1

- Read/write indexed PNGs with alpha

- Make meta info keys as enum

- document c++ classes

- static compilation

- remove SAIL_CHECK_xxx checks in codecs? Are they needed? libsail does them as well

## Priority 2

- Print more errors on 'return SAIL_ERROR_XXX'

- initializer lists in C++

- macros to hide boilerplate code in codecs

## Priority 3

- what to do when 'features' is 0 and we try to read an image?

- only-, except- cmake runtime defines for bindings ?

- document how SAIL uses codecs APIs

- enum class in C++?
